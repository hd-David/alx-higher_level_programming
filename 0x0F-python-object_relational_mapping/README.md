# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Project Description

The '0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping' project aims to teach you how to use an Object-relational mapper (ORM). Let’s dive into the details:

Project Goal: The primary goal of this project is to learn how to utilize an ORM. Specifically, you’ll work with two modules:
MySQLdb: This module allows you to connect to a MySQL database using Python.
SQLAlchemy: An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that abstracts the storage layer, allowing you to interact with your data using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.
